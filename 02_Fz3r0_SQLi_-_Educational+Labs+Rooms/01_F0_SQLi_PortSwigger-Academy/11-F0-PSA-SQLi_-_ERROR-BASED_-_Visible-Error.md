# `LAB`: Visible error-based SQL injection

## Descripción:

 This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs a SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie. The results of the SQL query are not returned.

The database contains a different table called `users`, with columns called `username` and `password`. To solve the lab, find a way to leak the `password` for the `administrator` user, then log in to their account.
