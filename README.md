Look behind you. I said, look behind you. My voice, can you hear it? This sign, can you read it? I'll wait forever if you'll just come to me.
Do you hear my voice? Can you hear your own soul's scream? Let us choose. My voice that tells the future. Or your tortured mind. Well, what do you choose? You can choose. Your life, your future....Wise as you are you might already have discovered it. 

Don't trust anyone.<br> 
Only our best will prevail.<br>
You have a right.<br>
A right to become one of us.<br>
So, welcome to our world.<br>
Very soon the gates to a new dimension will open.<br>
204863. <br>
204864. <br>204863﻿.<br>

**I walked. I could do nothing but walk... And then, I saw me walking in front of myself... But it wasn't really me...**

Forgive me, there's a monster inside of me. I can hear them calling to me from hell...

204863﻿.

No turning back now...

**Watch out. The gap in the door... It's a separate reality. The only me is me. Are you sure the only you is you?...**

... You've been chosen...
