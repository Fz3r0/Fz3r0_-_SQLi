### Por cada inyecci√≥n que recib√≠, ser√° una inyecci√≥n que regresar√©. <br><br> Desde el beso de Gaia que qued√≥ marcado en mi ser, se escuchar√°n los ecos de los gritos del Xibalba. <br><br>  La selva se defiende...

Convoco a las almas del macrocosmos, 
ninguna √©poca podr√° escapar de mi ira
Puedo viajar a trav√©z del tiempo y reunir sabidur√≠a ahora perdida
Yo soy los hechiceros oscuros, yo soy ellos, porque yo soy el esp√≠ritu de su existenica

Look behind you. I said, look behind you. My voice, can you hear it? This sign, can you read it? I'll wait forever if you'll just come to me.
Do you hear my voice? Can you hear your own soul's scream? Let us choose. My voice that tells the future. Or your tortured mind. Well, what do you choose? You can choose. Your life, your future....Wise as you are you might already have discovered it. 

Don't trust anyone.<br> 
Only our best will prevail.<br>
You have a right.<br>
A right to become one of us.<br>
So, welcome to our world.<br>
Very soon the gates to a new dimension will open.<br><br>

**I walked. I could do nothing but walk... And then, I saw me walking in front of myself... But it wasn't really me...**<br>

Forgive me, there's a monster inside of me. I can hear them calling to me from hell...<br>
204863Ôªø.

No turning back now...<br>

**Watch out. The gap in the door... It's a separate reality. The only me is me. Are you sure the only you is you?...**<br>

I am the Lord of Darkness. <br>
I require the solace of the shadows and the dark of the night. <br>
Sunshine is my destroyer. <br>
All this shall change. <br>

**Tonight, the sun sets forever. There shall never be another dawn.<br>**

**In the mist of the night you may see me come, where the sun where shadows move and demons lie... ...I am Fz3r0 and the Sun no longer rises...".** <br>

... You've been chosen...<br>
